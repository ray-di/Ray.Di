# Backward Compatibility

We will not break backward compatibility.

Ray.Di 2.0 was first released in 2015 and since then we've been supporting the latest PHP and adding features; we may no longer support PHP that has become deprecated, but we have never broken backwards compatibility, and we plan to continue to do so.
